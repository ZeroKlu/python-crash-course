## Chapter 11 Try-it-Yourself Assignments and Solutions

Here are my solutions for the chapter 11 try-it-yourself exercises.

### Assignment 11.1 - City, Country

Write a function that accepts two parameters: a city name and a country name. 
The function should return a single string of the form City, Country, such as 
`Santiago, Chile`. Store the function in a module called `city_functions.py`.

Create a file called `test_cities.py` that tests the function you just wrote 
(remember that you need to import `unittest` and the function you want to 
test). Write a method called `test_city_country()` to verify that calling 
your function with values such as `santiago` and `chile` results in the 
correct string. Run `test_cities.py`, and make sure `test_city_country()` 
passes.

### Assignment 11.2 - Population

Modify your function so it requires a third parameter, `population`. It 
should now return a single string of the form 
`City, Country – population xxx`, such as 
`Santiago, Chile – population 5000000`. Run `test_cities.py` again. Make sure 
`test_city_country()` fails this time. Modify the function so the population 
parameter is optional. Run `test_cities.py` again, and make sure 
`test_city_country()` passes again.

Write a second test called `test_city_country_population()` that verifies you 
can call your function with the values `santiago`, `chile`, and 
`population = 5000000`. Run `test_cities.py` again, and make sure this new 
test passes.

### Assignment 11.3 - Employee

Write a class called `Employee`. The `__init__()` method should take in a first name, a last name, and an annual salary, and store each of these as attributes. Write a method called `give_raise()` that adds $ 5,000 to the annual salary by default but also accepts a different raise amount.

Write a test case for `Employee`. Write two test methods,  `test_give_default_raise()` and `test_give_custom_raise()`. Use the `setUp()` method so you don't have to create a new employee instance in each test method. Run your test case, and make sure both tests pass.
