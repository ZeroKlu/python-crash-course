# Assignment 11.3
# Employee: Write a class called Employee. The __init__() method should take in a first name, a last name,
#           and an annual salary, and store each of these as attributes. Write a method called give_raise()
#           that adds $ 5,000 to the annual salary by default but also accepts a different raise amount.
#
#           Write a test case for Employee. Write two test methods, test_give_default_raise() and
#           test_give_custom_raise(). Use the setUp() method so you donâ€™t have to create a new employee
#           instance in each test method. Run your test case, and make sure both tests pass.
