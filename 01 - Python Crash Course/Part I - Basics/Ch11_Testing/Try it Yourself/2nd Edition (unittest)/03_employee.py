"""Assignment 11.3 (2nd Edition)"""

# Employee: Write a class called `Employee`. The `__init__()` method should
#           take in a first name, a last name, and an annual salary, and
#           store each of these as attributes. Write a method called
#           `give_raise()` that adds $5,000 to the annual salary by default
#           but also accepts a different raise amount.
#
#           Write a test case for Employee. Write two test methods,
#           `test_give_default_raise()` and `test_give_custom_raise()`.
#           Use the `setUp()` method so you don’t have to create a new
#           employee instance in each test method. Run your test case,
#           and make sure both tests pass.
