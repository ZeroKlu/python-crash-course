"""Assignment 11.1 (2nd Edition)"""

# City, Country: Write a function that accepts two parameters: a city name
#                and a country name. The function should return a single
#                string of the form "City, Country", such as "Santiago, Chile".
#                Store the function in a module called city_functions.py.
#
#                Create a file called `test_cities.py` that tests the function
#                you just wrote (remember that you need to import unittest and
#                the function you want to test). Write a method called
#                `test_city_country()` to verify that calling your function
#                with values such as 'santiago' and 'chile' and results in the
#                correct string format. Run `test_cities.py`, and make sure
#                `test_city_country()` passes.
