## Chapter 11 Try-it-Yourself Assignments and Solutions

Here are my solutions for the chapter 11 try-it-yourself exercises.

### Assignment 11.1 - City, Country

> Note: Assignments 11.1 and 11.2 are in [test_cities.py](./test_cities.py)

Write a function that accepts two parameters: a city name and a country name. The function should return a single string of the form `City, Country`, such as `Santiago, Chile`.

Store the function in a module called `city_functions.py`, and save this file in a new folder so pytest won't try to run the tests we've already written.

Create a file called `test_cities.py` that tests the function you just wrote. Write a function called `test_city_country()` to verify that calling your function with values such as `santiago` and `chile` results in the correct string. Run the test, and make sure `test_city_country()` passes.

### Assignment 11.2 - Population

Modify your function so it requires a third parameter, `population`. It 
should now return a single string of the form 
`City, Country – population xxx`, such as
`Santiago, Chile – population 5000000`. Run the test again, and make sure 
`test_city_country()` fails this time.

Modify the function so the population parameter is optional. Run the test, 
and make sure `test_city_country()` passes again. Write a second test called 
`test_city_country_population()` that verifies you can call your function 
with the values `santiago`, `chile`, and `population=5000000`. Run the tests 
one more time, and make sure this new test passes.

### Assignment 11.3 - Employee

Write a class called `Employee`. The `__init__()` method should take in a 
first name, a last name, and an annual salary, and store each of these as 
attributes. Write a method called `give_raise()` that adds $5,000 to the 
annual salary by default but also accepts a different raise amount.

Write a test file for Employee with two test functions, 
`test_give_default_raise()` and `test_give_custom_raise()`. Write your tests 
once without using a fixture, and make sure they both pass. Then write a 
fixture so you don't have to create a new employee instance in each test 
function. Run the tests again, and make sure both tests still pass.
