## Testing Classes

We can also use `pytest` to test classes. In order to accomplish this, we'll 
have to do a couple of extra tasks to ensure that the tests use a shared 
instance of the class.

Let's imagine that we have the following class:

<details open>
<summary>AnonymousSurvey Class</summary>

```python
class AnonymousSurvey:
    """Collect anonymous answers to a survey question."""
    
    def __init__(self, question: str) -> None:
        """Store a question, and prepare to store responses."""
        self.question = question
        self.responses = []
        
    def show_question(self) -> None:
        """Show the survey question."""
        print(self.question)
        
    def store_response(self, new_response: str) -> None:
        """Store a single response to the survey."""
        self.responses.append(new_response.lower())
        
    def show_results(self) -> None:
        """Show all the responses that have been given."""
        print("Survey results:")
        for response in set(self.responses):
            print(f"- {response.title()} ({self.responses.count(response)})")
```

</details>

## Setting Up the Test

We still construct a test case the same way we did for function testing, by
creating a `test_...` file.

However, now we will add a special component to the class: `@pytest.fixture`.

A *fixture* in pytest allows us to create a shared resource containing an 
instance of the class being tested, which is accessible to all of the unit 
test functions in the file.

In this instance, we're creating an instance of our `AnonymousSurvey` class.

```python
import pytest
from survey_class import AnonymousSurvey

@pytest.fixture
def language_survey():
    """A survey that will be available to all test functions."""
    question = "What language did you first learn to speak?"
    language_survey = AnonymousSurvey(question)
    return language_survey
```

After that you add unit test as normal, but the unit tests can use the shared
resource by including the fixture as an argument in the test case functions:

```python
def test_store_single_response(language_survey: AnonymousSurvey):
    """Test that a single response is stored properly."""
    language_survey.store_response("english")
    assert "english" in language_survey.responses

def test_store_three_responses(language_survey: AnonymousSurvey):
    """Test that three individual responses are stored properly."""
    responses = ['English', 'Spanish', 'Mandarin']
    for response in responses:
        language_survey.store_response(response.lower())

    for response in responses:
        assert response.lower() in language_survey.responses
```

## Testing

Like before, we run `pytest`

Output:

```
==================== test session starts ====================
platform win32 -- Python 3.11.4, pytest-8.3.2, pluggy-1.5.0
rootdir: ...\3rd Edition (pytest)
collected 2 items

test_surveys.py ..                                     [100%]

===================== 2 passed in 0.02s =====================
```

Play around changing the expectations or the class behavior to see different
test results.

## Multiple Tests

Unlike `unittest`, where we were running a specific file, by default, `pytest`
will execute all files in the directory with names starting with `test_...`.

With both of the tests from this chapter im place, we would have this output:

```
==================== test session starts ====================
platform win32 -- Python 3.11.4, pytest-8.3.2, pluggy-1.5.0
rootdir: ...\3rd Edition (pytest)
collected 4 items

test_name_function.py ..                               [ 50%]
test_survey_class.py ..                                [100%]

===================== 4 passed in 0.03s =====================
```

---

However, we can specify a given file. If we run this:

```pwsh
pytest test_survey_class.py
```

Only that file gets run:

```
==================== test session starts ====================
platform win32 -- Python 3.11.4, pytest-8.3.2, pluggy-1.5.0
rootdir: ...\3rd Edition (pytest)
collected 2 items

test_survey_class.py ..                                [100%]

===================== 2 passed in 0.01s =====================
```

---

### Verbose Logging

If we add the `-v` (verbose) switch to the command, `pytest` provides details
on passed tests as well as failed ones:

```pwsh
pytest -v test_survey_class.py
```

Output:

```
======================== test session starts ========================
platform win32 -- Python 3.11.4, pytest-8.3.2, pluggy-1.5.0
rootdir: ...\3rd Edition (pytest)
collected 2 items

test_survey_class.py::test_store_single_response PASSED        [ 50%]
test_survey_class.py::test_store_three_responses PASSED        [100%]

========================= 2 passed in 0.01s =========================
```

Play around changing the expectations or the class behavior to see different
test results.
