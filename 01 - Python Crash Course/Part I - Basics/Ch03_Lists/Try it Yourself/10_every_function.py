# Assignment 3.10
# Every Function: Think of something you could store in a list. For example, you could make a list of
#                 mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like.
#                 Write a program that creates a list containing these items and then uses each
#                 function introduced in this chapter at least once.
