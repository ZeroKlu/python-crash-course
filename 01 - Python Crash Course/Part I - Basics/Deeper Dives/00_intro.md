## Taking a Deeper Dive into Chapter Topics

In this section, we'll take a deeper dive into some of the same ideas that
we explored in the book chapters.

We'll be looking at some more complicated examples of the fundamental ideas
in Python.

Because we will be exploring efficient coding as well, we'll be using the
[sm_utils](https://pypi.org/project/sm-utils/) package that gets created in
the [Publish a Library](../../Part%20III%20-%20Beyond%20the%20Book/S13_Publish_a_Library/00_intro.md) lesson, which you can install with the 
following command:

```
python -m pip install sm_utils
```
