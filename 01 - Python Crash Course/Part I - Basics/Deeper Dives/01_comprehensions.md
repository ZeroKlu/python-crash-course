## Intermediate and Advanced List Comprehensions

We've already explored the use of list comprehensions as an alternative to
loops when populating lists.

Here, we'll review a few more examples of comprehensions and how they can 
be used.

In each example, I will include the example as a loop and then as a 
comprehension.

### Basic List Comprehension

As a review, here is an example of a basic list comprehension that creates
a list of the numbers 1 through 10.

```python
# Using a Loop
n = 10
numbers = []
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    numbers.append(i)
print(numbers)
```

```python
# Using a List Comprehension
n = 10
numbers = [i for i in range(1, n + 1)]
print(numbers)
```

Output:

The output is the same from either code sample:

```
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```

### List Comprehension with a Calculation

Because an expression is treated the same as the value it produces, we can
embed expressions in our list comprehensions.

Here is an example of a list comprehension that uses an expression
`i ** 2` to populate a list of the squares of the numbers 1 through 10.

```python
# Using a Loop
n = 10
numbers = []
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    numbers.append(i ** 2)
print(numbers)
```

```python
# Using a List Comprehension
n = 10
numbers = [i ** 2 for i in range(1, n + 1)]
print(numbers)
```

Output:

The output is the same from either code sample:

```
[1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
```

### Filtering a List Comprehension using an `if` Statement

We can append a condition to the end of a comprehension to include only the
values that match the condition as a filter.

This is an example of a list comprehension that uses a conditional
`if i % 2 == 0` to populate a list of only the even squares of the numbers 
1 through 10.

```python
# Using a Loop
n = 10
numbers = []
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        numbers.append(i ** 2)
print(numbers)
```

```python
# Using a List Comprehension
n = 10
numbers = [i ** 2 for i in range(1, n + 1) if i % 2 == 0]
print(numbers)
```

Output:

The output is the same from either code sample:

```
[4, 16, 36, 64, 100]
```

### Efficiency

Looking at how comprehensions are structured, it's easy to assume that
there isn't a measurable difference between explicitly using a loop and
embedding the scope of the loop in a comprehension.

But assumptions aren't ever wise in programming. Let's test the 
proposition.

You can use whatever timing mechanism you want, but in my example, we'll 
use the `@timer` decorator from the `sm_utils` library.

Here, we'll compare the time it takes to compute a list containing the
squares of the first million integers using a loop versus a comprehension.

```python
from sm_utils import timer

@timer
def timed_for_loop(n: int) -> list[int]:
    """Calculate squares of numbers from 1 to n using a for loop"""
    result = []
    for i in range(n):
        result.append(i ** 2)
    return result

@timer
def timed_list_comprehension(n: int) -> list[int]:
    """Calculate squares of numbers from 1 to n using list comprehension"""
    return [i ** 2 for i in range(n)]

n = 10 ** 6
print("First million squares:\n")
print("Using for_loop...")
timed_for_loop(n)
print("Using list_comprehension...")
timed_list_comprehension(n)
```

Output:

```
First million squares:

Using for_loop...
Execution Time: 50.344 ms

Using list_comprehension...
Execution Time: 41.93 ms
```

Consistently, the list comprehension requires around 20% less time than the
explicit loop to complete the task.

### Nested List Comprehensions

Just like loops, we can nest comprehensions.

Here is an example of a nested list comprehension that produces a 3x3 2D 
matrix.

```python
# Using a Loop
n = 3
matrix = []
for i in range(n):
    row = []
    for j in range(n):
        row.append(i * j)
    matrix.append(row)
for row in matrix:
    print(row)
```

```python
# Using a List Comprehension
n = 3
matrix = [[i * j for j in range(n)] for i in range(n)]
for row in matrix:
    print(row)
```

Output:

```
[0, 0, 0]
[0, 1, 2]
[0, 2, 4]
```

You can see that when nesting, the list comprehension takes much less code
and is substantially more readable.
