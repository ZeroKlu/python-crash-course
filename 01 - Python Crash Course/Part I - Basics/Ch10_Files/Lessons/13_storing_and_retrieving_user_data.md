## Storing and Retrieving User Data Using a JSON File

The next step in designing a "remember me" process is to combine the
steps in the previous code samples.

The new process should:

* Check to see if a user JSON file exists
   
    * If it does exist:
        1. Load the user data from JSON
        2. Greet the user
        3. Skip further steps...

    * If it does not exist
        1. Prompt the user to enter first and last name
        2. Store a user JSON file
        3. Let the user know that we will remember

### Combining the Process

For now, let's just build the logic as a single function.
