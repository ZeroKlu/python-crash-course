## Working with JSON Files

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a method for representing 
an object or collection of objects as a string.

The structure of JSON is very similar to the structure of a 
dictionary and allows storing values, lists, and nested objects 
or dictionaries.

For example, if I have a dictionary like this:

```python
my_dict = {
    "name": {
        "first": "john",
        "last": "doe"
    },
    "age": 25,
    "subjects": ["python", "json files"]
}
```

The JSON representation would look identical to the dictionary:

```json
{
    "name": {
        "first": "john",
        "last": "doe"
    },
    "age": 25,
    "subjects": ["python", "json files"]
}
```

This makes JSON a perfect candidate for storing data in external 
files between executions.

### How to Work with JSON

Python provides the `json` module in the PSL to expose functions 
for reading and writing JSON files.

### Writing JSON to a File

Here, we'll store a simple object as JSON in a file.

For this, we'll import the `json` module and use the `json.dump` 
function to write it to a file.

```python
import json
import os

numbers = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13]
numbers_object = {"numbers" : numbers}

file_name = "numbers.json"
file_path = os.path.join(ROOT_DIR, "Files", file_name)
    json.dump(numbers_object, f)

print(f"Stored JSON file [{file_name}]")

with open(file_path) as f:
    print(f.read().rstrip())
```

Output:

```
Stored JSON file [numbers.json]
{"numbers": [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13]}
```

### Loading JSON from a File

Python module also exposes the `json.load()` method to read JSON from a
file and store its result in a dictionary.

```python
import os
import json

ROOT_DIR = os.path.dirname(__file__)

file_name = "numbers.json"
file_path = os.path.join(ROOT_DIR, "Files", file_name)

with open(file_path) as f:
    numbers_object = json.load(f)

print(numbers_object)
```

Output:

```
{'numbers': [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13]}
```

### Writing JSON to a File

Here, we'll store a simple object as JSON in a file.

For this, we'll import the `json` module and since we are using a `Path`
object, we'll store the JSON to a string using the `json.dumps()` method 
before writing to the file .

```python
import json
from relative_paths import get_path
from pathlib import Path

numbers = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13]
numbers_object = {"numbers" : numbers}

file_name = "numbers.json"
file_path = get_path("numbers.json", "Files")

contents = json.dumps(numbers_object)
file = Path(file_path)
file.write_text(contents)

print(f"Stored JSON file [{file_name}]")

print(file.read_text())
```

Output:

```
Stored JSON file [numbers.json]
{"numbers": [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13]}
```

### Loading JSON from a File

Python module also exposes the `json.loads()` method to read JSON from a
string (in this case, after reading from a file) and store its result 
in a dictionary.

```python
from relative_paths import get_path
from pathlib import Path
import json

file_name = "numbers.json"
file_path = get_path(file_name, "Files")

file = Path(file_path)
numbers_object = json.loads(file.read_text())

print(numbers_object)
```

Output:

```
{'numbers': [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13]}
```
