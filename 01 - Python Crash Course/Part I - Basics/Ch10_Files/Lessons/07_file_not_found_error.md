## Handling a `FileNotFoundError`

It's inevitable that sometimes our programs will look for files that aren't 
there.

For this lesson, you'll need to create a path to a file that doesn't exist.

My code uses the relative path `.\Files\alice_missing.txt`

### `FileNotFoundError` Thrown During `open(file_path)`

Let's investigate what happens when we look for a missing file.

> Side Note: We're want to the `split()` method, which (splits a string into
> a list) two ways:
> * Specifying a split character (in this case `\`)
> * Omitting the splitting character, which defaults to a space ` `

When the file we attempt to open is missing, Python throws a 
`FileNotFoundError`, so we'll handle that in our `except` block.

```python
import os

ROOT_DIR = os.path.dirname(__file__)
file_path = os.path.join(ROOT_DIR, "Files", "alice_missing.txt")

file_name = file_path.split("\\")[-1]

try:
    with open(file_path, encoding='utf-8') as f:
        contents = f.read()
except FileNotFoundError:
    print(f"Sorry, the file [{file_name}] does not exist.")
else:
    words = contents.split()
    num_words = len(words)
    print(f"The file {file_name} has about {num_words} words.")
```

Output:

```
Sorry, the file [alice_missing.txt] does not exist.
```

### `FileNotFoundError` Thrown During `Path.read_text()`

Let's investigate what happens when we look for a missing file.

When the file we attempt to open is missing, Python throws a 
`FileNotFoundError`, so we'll handle that in our `except` block.

```python
from relative_paths import get_path
from pathlib import Path

file_path = get_path("alice_missing.txt", "Files")
file_name = file_path.split("\\")[-1]

try:
    file = Path(file_name)
    contents = file.read_text()
except FileNotFoundError:
    print(f"Sorry, the file [{file_name}] does not exist.")
else:
    words = contents.split()
    num_words = len(words)
    print(f"The file {file_name} has about {num_words} words.")
```

Output:

```
Sorry, the file [alice_missing.txt] does not exist.
```
