"""Assignment 10.2 (2nd Edition)"""

# Verify User: The final listing for remember_me.py assumes either that the
#              user has already entered their username or that the program is
#              running for the first time. We should modify it in case the
#              current user is not the person who last used the program.
#              Before printing a welcome back message in `greet_user()`, ask
#              the user if this is the correct username. If it's not, call
#              `get_new_username()` to get the correct username.
