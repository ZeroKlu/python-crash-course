# Assignment 10.6
# Addition: One common problem when prompting for numerical input occurs when people provide text instead
#           of numbers. When you try to convert the input to an int, you'll get a ValueError. Write a program
#           that prompts for two numbers. Add them together and print the result. Catch the ValueError if
#           either input value is not a number, and print a friendly error message. Test your program by
#           entering two numbers and then by entering some text instead of a number.
