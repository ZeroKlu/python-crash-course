"""Assignment 10.1 (3rd Edition)"""

# Cats and Dogs: Make two files, `cats.txt` and `dogs.txt`. Store at least
#                three names of cats in the first file and three names of
#                dogs in the second file. Write a program that tries to
#                read these files and print the contents of the file to
#                the screen. Wrap your code in a try-except block to catch
#                the FileNotFound error, and print a friendly message if
#                a file is missing. Move one of the files to a different
#                location on your system, and make sure the code in the
#                except block executes properly.
