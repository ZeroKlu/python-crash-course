## Chapter 10 Try-it-Yourself Assignments and Solutions

Here are my solutions for the chapter 10 try-it-yourself exercises.

> Because the 2nd and 3rd editions of the textbook present different 
> approaches to file system interaction, I will present separate solutions for
> these editions for each problem. This file covers the 3rd edition answers.

For all 3rd edition problems, I will use the code below:

<details>
<summary>Relative Paths Module</summary>

In [relative_paths.py](./relative_paths.py)

```python
"""A module to expose a simple method to interact with files via relative path"""

from os import path

ROOT_DIR = None

def get_path(file_name: str, folder: str=None, parent_levels: int=0, debug: bool=False) -> str:

### Assignment 10.1 - Learning Python

Open a blank file in your text editor and write a few lines summarizing what
you've learned about Python so far. Start each line with the phrase
`In Python you can...` Save the file as `learning_python.txt` in the same 
directory as your exercises from this chapter. Write a program that reads the 
file and prints what you wrote three times. Print the contents once by 
reading in the entire file, once by looping over the file object, and once by 
storing the lines in a list and then working with them outside the with block.

### Assignment 10.2 - Learning C

You can use the `replace()` method to replace any word in a string with a 
different word. Here's a quick example showing how to replace `dog` with 
`cat` in a sentence:

```python
>>> message = "I really like dogs."
>>> message.replace('dog', 'cat')
'I really like cats.'
```

Read in each line from the file you just created, learning_python.txt, and replace the word Python with the name of another language, such as C. Print each modified line to the screen.

### Assignment 10.3 - Simpler Code

The program [`file_reader.py`](../Textbook%20Downloads/E3/reading_from_a_file/file_reader.py) in this section uses a temporary variable, lines, to show how 
`splitlines()` works. You can skip the temporary variable and loop directly 
over the list that `splitlines()` returns:

```python
for line in contents.splitlines():
    ...
```

Remove the temporary variable from each of the programs in this section, to 
make them more concise.

### Assignment 10.6 - Addition

One common problem when prompting for numerical input occurs when people 
provide text instead of numbers. When you try to convert the input to an 
`int`, you'll get a `ValueError`. Write a program that prompts for two 
numbers. Add them together and print the result. Catch the `ValueError` if 
either input value is not a number, and print a friendly error message. Test 
your program by entering two numbers and then by entering some text instead 
of a number.

Solution:

<details>
<summary>Spoiler Code</summary>

```python
numbers = []

while len(numbers) < 2:
    response = input("Enter a number:\n> ")
    if response == None or len(response) < 1:
        print("You cannot leave the entry blank.")
        continue
    try:
        number = int(response)
        numbers.append(number)
    except ValueError:
        print("Please only enter numbers.")

sum = numbers[0] + numbers[1]
print(f"\n{numbers[0]} + {numbers[1]} = {sum}")
```

### Assignment 10.8 - Cats and Dogs

Make two files, `cats.txt` and `dogs.txt`. Store at least three names of cats in the first file and three names of dogs in the second file. Write a program that tries to read these files and print the contents of the file to the screen. Wrap your code in a `try`-`except` block to catch the `FileNotFound` error, and print a friendly message if a file is missing. Move one of the files to a different location on your system, and make sure the code in the except block executes properly.

### Assignment 10.10 - Common Words

Visit [Project Gutenberg](https://gutenberg.org/) and find a few texts you'd 
like to analyze. Download the text files for these works, or copy the raw 
text from your browser into a text file on your computer. You can use the 
`count()` method to find out how many times a word or phrase appears in a 
string. For example, the following code counts the number of times `row` 
appears in a string:

```python
>>> line = "Row, row, row your boat"
>>> line.count('row')
2
>>> line.lower().count('row')
3
```

Notice that converting the string to lowercase using `lower()` catches all 
appearances of the word you're looking for, regardless of how it's formatted. 
Write a program that reads the files you found at Project Gutenberg and 
determines how many times the word `the` appears in each text. This will be 
an approximation because it will also count words such as `then` and `there`. 
Try counting `the `, with a space in the string, and see how much lower your 
count is.

### Assignment 10.13 - User Dictionary

The [remember_me.py](../Textbook%20Downloads/E3/storing_data/remember_me.py)

store all the information you collect in a dictionary. Write this dictionary

### Assignment 10.14 - Verify User

The final listing for
[remember_me.py](../Textbook%20Downloads/E3/storing_data/remember_me.py) 
assumes either that the user has already entered their username or that the 
program is running for the first time. We should modify it in case the 
current user is not the person who last used the program. Before printing a 
welcome back message in `greet_user()`, ask the user if this is the correct 
username. If it's not, call `get_new_username()` to get the correct username.
