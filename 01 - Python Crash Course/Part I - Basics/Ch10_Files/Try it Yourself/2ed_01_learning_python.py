# Assignment 10.1
# Learning Python: Open a blank file in your text editor and write a few lines summarizing what
#                  youâ€™ve learned about Python so far. Start each line with the phrase 'In Python you can...'
#                  Save the file as learning_python.txt in the same directory as your exercises from this
#                  chapter. Write a program that reads the file and prints what you wrote three times. Print
#                  the contents once by reading in the entire file, once by looping over the file object, and
#                  once by storing the lines in a list and then working with them outside the with block.
