# Assignment 7.5
# Movie Tickets: A movie theater charges different ticket prices depending on a person's age.
#                If a person is under the age of 3, the ticket is free; if they are between 3 and 12, the ticket is $ 10;
#                and if they are over age 12, the ticket is $ 15. Write a loop in which you ask users their age,
#                and then tell them the cost of their movie ticket.
