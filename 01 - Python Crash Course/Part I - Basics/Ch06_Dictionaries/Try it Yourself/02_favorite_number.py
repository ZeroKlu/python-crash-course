# Assignment 6.2
# Favorite Numbers: Use a dictionary to store people’s favorite numbers. Think of five names, and use them
#                   as keys in your dictionary. Think of a favorite number for each person, and store each as
#                   a value in your dictionary. Print each person’s name and their favorite number.
#                   For even more fun, poll a few friends and get some actual data for your program.
