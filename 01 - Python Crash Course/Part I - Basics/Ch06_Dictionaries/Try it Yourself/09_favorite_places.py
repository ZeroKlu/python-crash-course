"""Assignment 6.9"""

# Favorite Places: Make a dictionary called `favorite_places`. Think of
#                  three names to use as keys in the dictionary, and
#                  store one to three favorite places for each person.
#                  To make this exercise a bit more interesting, ask some
#                  friends to name a few of their favorite places. Loop
#                  through the dictionary, and print each personâ€™s name
#                  and their favorite places.
