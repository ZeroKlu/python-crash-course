## Read a File Line-by-Line

Often, you will want to read one line at a time from a file. This allows the
developer to review each line's content and potentially perform different tasks
depending on whether or not the line contains specific text.

For this example, I have provided the following text file:  
[pi_digits.txt](./Files/pi_digits.txt)

### Parsing the `open()` File Handler as a List

The `TextIOWrapper` object returned by the `open()` function is already
enumerable. You can traverse the content as though it were a list, where the
items are the lines (text blocks separated by newline characters).

```python
import os

ROOT_DIR = os.path.dirname(__file__)
file_path = os.path.join(ROOT_DIR, "Files", "pi_digits.txt")

with open(file_path) as file_object:
    for line in file_object:
        print(line.rstrip())
```

Output:

```
3.1415926535
  8979323846
  2643383279
```

### Using the `readlines()` Method

If you will be performing a lot of work on each line or the text contains many
lines, it may be impractical to keep the file open throughout processing.

In a scenario where it is preferable to release the file before processing the
lines, you can use the `readlines()` method.

```python
import os

ROOT_DIR = os.path.dirname(__file__)
file_path = os.path.join(ROOT_DIR, "Files", "pi_digits.txt")

with open(file_path) as file_object:
    lines = file_object.readlines()

for line in lines:
    print(line.rstrip())
```

Output:

```
3.1415926535
  8979323846
  2643383279
```

### Using `splitlines()`

With the `Path` class, after you read the text, you can use the `splitlines()` 
method from the `str` class to create a list of lines to parse.

```python
from relative_paths import get_path
from pathlib import Path

file_path = get_path("pi_digits.txt", "Files")

path_object = Path(file_path)
text = path_object.read_text()

lines = text.splitlines()
for line in lines:
    print(line.rstrip())
```

Output:

```
3.1415926535
  8979323846
  2643383279
```
