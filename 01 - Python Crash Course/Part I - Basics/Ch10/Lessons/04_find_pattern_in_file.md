## Read a File and Search for a Pattern

Another common file system task for a developer is to search a file to see
if a specific pattern appears in the text.

This is so common that most operating systems include utilities for this task.
In Linux, you have `grep`, in Windows you have `findstr.exe`, and in PowerShell
you have `Select-String`.

For this example, I have provided the following text file:  
[pi_million_digits.txt](./Files/pi_million_digits.txt)

> Note: the process to obtain file paths is covered here:  
> [00_bonus_relative_paths.md](./00_bonus_relative_paths.md)

### Find Pattern in File Data

We'll merge the file content into a string, just like we did in the previous
lesson, and then search the resulting data for the string a user enters.

```python
import os

ROOT_DIR = os.path.dirname(__file__)
file_path = os.path.join(ROOT_DIR, "Files", "pi_million_digits.txt")

pi_string = ""

with open(file_path) as file_object:
    for line in file_object:
        pi_string += line.strip()

birthday = input("Enter your birthday in the form MMDDYY:\n> ")

if birthday in pi_string:
    print("Yay! Your birthday appears in the first million digits of pi!")
else:
    print("Aww... Your birthday does not appears in the first million digits of pi.")

print()
```

I'll pretend the user entered `010270`

Output:

```
Enter your birthday in the form MMDDYY:
> 010270
Yay! Your birthday appears in the first million digits of pi!
```

### Find Pattern in File Data

We'll merge the file content into a string, just like we did in the previous
lesson, and then search the resulting data for the string a user enters.

```python
from relative_paths import get_path
from pathlib import Path

file_path = get_path("pi_million_digits.txt", "Files")

pi_string = ""

path_object = Path(file_path)
text = path_object.read_text()

lines = text.splitlines()
for line in lines:
    pi_string += line.strip()

birthday = input("Enter your birthday in the form MMDDYY:\n> ")

if birthday in pi_string:
    print("Yay! Your birthday appears in the first million digits of pi!")
else:
    print("Aww... Your birthday does not appears in the first million digits of pi.")
```

I'll pretend the user entered `030470`

Output:

```
Enter your birthday in the form MMDDYY:
> 030470
Aww... Your birthday does not appears in the first million digits of pi
```
