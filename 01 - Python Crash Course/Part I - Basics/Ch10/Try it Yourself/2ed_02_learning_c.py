# Assignment 10.2
# Learning C: You can use the replace() method to replace any word in a string with a different word.
#             Here’s a quick example showing how to replace 'dog' with 'cat' in a sentence: 
#             -----------------------------------
#             >>> message = "I really like dogs."
#             >>> message.replace('dog', 'cat')
#             'I really like cats.'
#             -----------------------------------
#             Read in each line from the file you just created, learning_python.txt, and replace the word
#             Python with the name of another language, such as C. Print each modified line to the screen.
