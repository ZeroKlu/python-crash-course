# Assignment 9.4
# Number Served: Start with your program from Exercise 9-1. Add an attribute called number_served with a
#                default value of 0. Create an instance called restaurant from this class. Print the number
#                of customers the restaurant has served, and then change this value and print it again.
#
#                Add a method called set_number_served() that lets you set the number of customers that
#                have been served. Call this method with a new number and print the value again.
#
#                Add a method called increment_number_served() that lets you increment the number of customers
#                who've been served. Call this method with any number you like that could represent how many customers
#                were served in, say, a day of business.
