"""Assignment 9.16"""

# Python Module of the Week: One excellent resource for exploring the
#        Python standard library is a site called Python Module of the
#        Week. Go to https://pymotw.com/ and look at the table of contents.
#        Find a module that looks interesting to you and read about it,
#        perhaps starting with the `random` module.
