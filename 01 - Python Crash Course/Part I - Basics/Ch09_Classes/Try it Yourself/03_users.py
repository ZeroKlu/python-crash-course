"""Exercise 9.3"""

# Users: Make a class called User. Create two attributes called
#        `first_name` and `last_name`, and then create several
#        other attributes that are typically stored in a user
#        profile. Make a method called `describe_user()` that
#        prints a summary of the user's information. Make another
#        method called `greet_user()` that prints a personalized
#        greeting to the user. Create several instances representing
#        different users, and call both methods for each user.
