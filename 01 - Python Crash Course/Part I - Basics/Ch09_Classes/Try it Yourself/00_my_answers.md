## Chapter 9 Try-it-Yourself Assignments and Solutions

Here are my solutions for the chapter 9 try-it-yourself exercises.

---

### Assignment 9.1 - Restaurant

Make a class called `Restaurant`. The `__init__()` method for `Restaurant` should store two attributes: a `restaurant_name` and a `cuisine_type`. Make a method called `describe_restaurant()` that prints these two pieces of information, and a method called `open_restaurant()` that prints a message indicating that the restaurant is open. Make an instance called `restaurant` from your class. Print the two attributes individually, and then call both methods.


Solution:

<summary>Spoiler Code</summary>

```python
class Restaurant:
    """Defines a restaurant object"""
    def __init__(self, name, cuisine):
        """Initialize a new instance of the Restaurant class"""
        self.name = name
        self.cuisine = cuisine

    def describe(self):
        """Print a description of the restaurant"""
        print(f"{self.name.title()} proudly serves {self.cuisine.title()}")

    def open(self):
        """Open the restaurant"""
        print(f"{self.name.title()} is open for business!")

restaurant = Restaurant("the mad greek", "greek & indian food")
print(restaurant.name.title())
print(restaurant.cuisine.title())
restaurant.describe()
restaurant.open()
```

</details>
<br>

<details>
<summary>Output</summary>

```
The Mad Greek
Greek & Indian Food
The Mad Greek proudly serves Greek & Indian Food
The Mad Greek is open for business!
```

</details>

### Assignment 9.2 - Three Restaurants

Start with your class from Exercise 9.1. Create three different instances 
from the class, and call `describe_restaurant()` for each instance.

Solution:

<summary>Spoiler Code</summary>

```python
class Restaurant:
    """Defines a restaurant object"""
    def __init__(self, name, cuisine):
        """Initialize a new instance of the Restaurant class"""
        self.name = name
        self.cuisine = cuisine

    def describe(self):
        """Print a description of the restaurant"""
        print(f"{self.name.title()} proudly serves {self.cuisine.title()}!")

    def open(self):
        """Open the restaurant"""
        print(f"{self.name.title()} is open for business!")

restaurant_1 = Restaurant("The Mad Greek", "Greek & Indian food")
restaurant_2 = Restaurant("Charlie's Crab", "seafood")
restaurant_3 = Restaurant("The Brown Derby", "steak")

restaurant_1.describe()
restaurant_2.describe()
restaurant_3.describe()
```

</details>

<summary>Output</summary>

```
The Mad Greek proudly serves Greek & Indian Food!
Charlie'S Crab proudly serves Seafood!
The Brown Derby proudly serves Steak!
```

### Assignment 9.3 - Users

Make a class called `User`. Create two attributes called `first_name` and 
`last_name`, and then create several other attributes that are typically 
stored in a user profile. Make a method called `describe_user()` that prints 
a summary of the user's information. Make another method called
`greet_user()` that prints a personalized greeting to the user. Create 
several instances representing different users, and call both methods for 
each user.

Solution:

<summary>Spoiler Code</summary>

```python
class User:
    """Defines a user"""

    def __init__(self, first_name, last_name, location, profession):
        """Initialize a new instance of the User class"""
        self.first_name = first_name
        self.last_name = last_name
        self.location = location
        self.profession = profession

    def greet(self):
        """Greet the user"""
        print(
            f"Hello there, {self.first_name.title()} {self.last_name.title()}")

    def describe(self):
        """Describe the user"""
        print(
            f"Name:       {self.first_name.title()} {self.last_name.title()}")
        print(f"Location:   {self.location.title()}")
        print(f"Profession: {self.profession.title()}\n")


user_1 = User("scott", "mclean", location="dallas", profession="programmer")
user_1.greet()
user_1.describe()

user_2 = User("hillary", "taylor", location="twinsburg", profession="lawyer")
user_2.greet()
user_2.describe()

user_3 = User("jeremy", "mclean", location="columbus",
              profession="restaurant manager")
user_3.greet()
user_3.describe()
```

### Assignment 9.4 - Number Served

Start with your program from Exercise 9.1. Add an attribute called 
`number_served` with a default value of 0. Create an instance called 
restaurant from this class. Print the number of customers the restaurant has 
served, and then change this value and print it again.

Add a method called `set_number_served()` that lets you set the number of 
customers that have been served. Call this method with a new number and print 
the value again.

Add a method called `increment_number_served()` that lets you increment the 
number of customers who've been served. Call this method with any number you 
like that could represent how many customers were served in, say, a day of 
business.

### Assignment 9.5 - Login Attempts

Add an attribute called `login_attempts` to your `User` class from Exercise 9.3. Write a method called `increment_login_attempts()` that increments the value of `login_attempts` by `1`. Write another method called `reset_login_attempts()` that resets the value of `login_attempts` to `0`.

Make an instance of the `User` class and call `increment_login_attempts()` several times. Print the value of `login_attempts` to make sure it was incremented properly, and then call `reset_login_attempts()`. Print `login_attempts` again to make sure it was reset to `0`.

### Assignment 9.6 - Ice Cream Stand

An ice cream stand is a specific kind of restaurant. Write a class called `IceCreamStand` that inherits from the `Restaurant` class you wrote in Exercise 9.1 or Exercise 9.4. Either version of the class will work; just pick the one you like better. Add an attribute called `flavors` that stores a list of ice cream flavors. Write a method that displays these flavors. Create an instance of `IceCreamStand`, and call this method.

### Assignment 9.8 - Privileges

Write a separate `Privileges` class. The class should have one attribute, `privileges`, that stores a list of strings as described in Exercise 9.7. Move the `show_privileges()` method to this class.

Make a `Privileges` instance as an attribute in the `Admin` class. Create a new instance of `Admin` and use your method to show its privileges.

### Assignment 9.9 - Battery Upgrade

Use the final version of electric_car.py from this section. Add a method to the `Battery` class called `upgrade_battery()`. This method should check the battery size and set the capacity to 100 if it isn't already. Make an electric car with a default battery size, call `get_range()` once, and then call `get_range()` a second time after upgrading the battery. You should see an increase in the car's range.
