# Assignment 9.9
# Battery Upgrade: Use the final version of electric_car.py from this section. Add a method to the Battery class
#                  called upgrade_battery(). This method should check the battery size and set the capacity to 100
#                  if it isn't already. Make an electric car with a default battery size, call get_range() once,
#                  and then call get_range() a second time after upgrading the battery. You should see an increase
#                  in the car's range.
