# Assignment 9.13
# Dice: Make a class Die with one attribute called sides, which has a default value of 6.
#       Write a method called roll_die() that prints a random number between 1 and the number of sides
#       the die has. Make a 6-sided die and roll it 10 times. Make a 10-sided die and a 20-sided die.
#       Roll each die 10 times.
