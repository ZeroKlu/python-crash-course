# Assignment 6.9
# Favorite Places: Make a dictionary called favorite_places. Think of three names to use as keys in the
#                  dictionary, and store one to three favorite places for each person. To make this exercise
#                  a bit more interesting, ask some friends to name a few of their favorite places. Loop through
#                  the dictionary, and print each personâ€™s name and their favorite places.
