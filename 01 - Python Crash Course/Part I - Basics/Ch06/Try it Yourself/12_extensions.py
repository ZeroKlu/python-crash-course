# Assignment 6.12
# Extensions: Weâ€™re now working with examples that are complex enough that they can be extended in any number of
#             ways. Use one of the example programs from this chapter, and extend it by adding new keys and values,
#             changing the context of the program or improving the formatting of the output.
