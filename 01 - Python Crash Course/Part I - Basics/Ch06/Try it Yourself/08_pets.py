# Assignment 6.8
# Pets: Make several dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a different pet. In each dictionary,
#       include the kind of animal and the ownerâ€™s name. Store these dictionaries in a list called pets.
#       Next, loop through your list and as you do, print everything you know about each pet.
