"""Assignment 5.7"""

# Favorite Fruit: Make a list of your favorite fruits,
#                 and then write a series of independent if
#                 statements that check for certain fruits
#                 in your list.
#         • Make a list of your three favorite fruits and call it
#           `favorite_fruits`.
#         • Write five if statements. Each should check whether a
#           certain kind of fruit is in your list.
#         • If the fruit is in your list, the if block should print
#           a statement, such as "You like bananas!"
