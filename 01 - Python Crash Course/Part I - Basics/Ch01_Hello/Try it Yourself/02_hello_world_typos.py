# Simple Message: Open the `hello_world.py` file you just created. Make a
# typo somewhere in the line and run the program again. Can you make a typo
# that generates an error? Can you make sense of the error message? Can you
# make a typo that doesn't generate an error? Why do you think it didn't make
# an error?
