### Assignment 1.2 - Hello World Typos:

Open the `hello_world.py` file you just created. Make a typo somewhere in the 
line and run the program again. Can you make a typo that generates an error? 
Can you make sense of the error message? Can you make a typo that doesn't 
generate an error? Why do you think it didn't make an error?

Solution:

<details>
<summary>Spoiler Code</summary>
<br>

<details>
<summary>Syntax Error</summary>
<br>

This code results in a `SyntaxError` because the function call is missing
parentheses.

```python
print "Hello World!"
```

</details>
<br>

<details>
<summary>Name Error</summary>
<br>

This code results in a `SyntaxError` because there is no function called
`printf()`.

```python
printf("Hello World!")
```

</details>
<br>

<details>
<summary>No Error</summary>

This code does not result in an error, because Python will print any string in
the `print()` function, regardless of spelling. 

```python
print("Wello Horld!")
```

</details>

</details>
<br>

<details>
<summary>Output</summary>
<br>

<details>
<summary>Syntax Error</summary>
<br>

```
File "...\02_hello_world_typos.py", line 14    print "Hello World!"     
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
SyntaxError: Missing parentheses in call to 'print'. Did you mean print(...)?
```

</details>
<br>

<details>
<summary>Name Error</summary>
<br>

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "...\02_hello_world_typos.py", line 16, in <module>
    printf("Hello World!")
    ^^^^^^
NameError: name 'printf' is not defined. Did you mean: 'print'?
```

</details>

```

### Assignment 1.3 - Infinite Skills

If you had infinite programming skills, what would you build? You're about to 
learn how to program. If you have an end goal in mind, you'll have an 
immediate use for your new skills; now is a great time to write brief 
descriptions of what you want to create. It's a good habit to keep an "ideas" 
notebook that you can refer to whenever you want to start a new project. Take 
a few minutes now to describe three programs you want to create.

Solution:

<details>
<summary>Spoiler Code</summary>

```python
# No solution code
print("Perform this task on your own.")
```

</details>
<br>

<details>
<summary>Output</summary>

```
Perform this task on your own.
```
