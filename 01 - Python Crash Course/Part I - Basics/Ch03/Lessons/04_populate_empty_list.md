## Populate an Empty List

One common way of populating lists is to initialize an empty list `[]` and 
then add items to it during the program execution.

```python
motorcycles = []
motorcycles.append("honda")
motorcycles.append("yamaha")
motorcycles.append("suzuki")
motorcycles.append("triumph")
print(motorcycles)
```

Output:

```
['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki', 'triumph']
```
