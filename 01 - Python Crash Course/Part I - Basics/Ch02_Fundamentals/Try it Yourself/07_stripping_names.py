# Assignment 2.7
# Stripping Names: Use a variable to represent a person's name, and include some whitespace characters at the
#                  beginning and end of the name. Make sure you use each character combination, "\t" and "\n",
#                  at least once. Print the name once, so the whitespace around the name is displayed.
#                  Then print the name using each of the three stripping functions, lstrip(), rstrip(), and strip().
