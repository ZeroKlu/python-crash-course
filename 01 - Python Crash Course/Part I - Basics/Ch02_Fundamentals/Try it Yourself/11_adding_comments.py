"""Assignment 2.11"""

# Adding Comments: Choose two of the programs you’ve written,
#                  and add at least one comment to each.
#                  If you don’t have anything specific to write because
#                  your programs are too simple at this point, just add
#                  your name and the current date at the top of each program
#                  file. Then write one sentence describing what the program does.
