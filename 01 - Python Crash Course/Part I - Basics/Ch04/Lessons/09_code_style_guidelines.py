# Exercise 7 - Code Style Guidelines
# Style Guide (PEP-8): https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/
#  - All indents should be four spaces
#  - Limit code to 79 characters per line (at DataBank, we use a 120-character limit [*usually])
#  - Limit comments to 72 characters per line (I have violated this in the lesson files)
#  - Use blank lines to group functionally related sections of code (but not to excess)
