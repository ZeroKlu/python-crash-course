# Exercise 4-15
# Code Review: Choose three of the programs you’ve written in this chapter and modify each one to comply with PEP 8.
#              • Use four spaces for each indentation level. Set your text editor to insert four spaces every time you
#                press the TAB key, if you haven’t already done so (see Appendix B for instructions on how to do this).
#              • Use less than 80 characters on each line, and set your editor to show a vertical guideline at the
#                80th character position.
#              • Don’t use blank lines excessively in your program files.

# To set your tab size to 4 spaces in VS Code (note: it already is at this setting by default):
# 1. Press Ctrl+Shift+P to open the menu
# 2. Enter "settings" in the search and select "Preferences: Open Settings (UI)"
# 3. Enter "tab size" in the search. Make sure the setting for "Editor: Tab Size" is "4"

# To set a guideline at the 120-character limit
# 1. Press Ctrl+Shift+P to open the menu
# 2. Enter "settings" in the search and select "Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)"
# 3. At the end of the last item inside the curly-braces, type a comma (",")
# 4. Add a new line containing the following:
#    "editor.rulers": [120]

# Note: You can add as many guidelines as you want. e.g.:
#       "editor.rulers": [80, 120]

# Do this one on your own
