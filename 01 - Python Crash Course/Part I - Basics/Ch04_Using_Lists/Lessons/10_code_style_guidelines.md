## Style Guidelines

For references on coding style standards, consult the
[Style Guide (PEP-8)](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/)

---

Some specific rules to which our team subscribes include:

* All indents should be four spaces
* Limit code to 79 characters per line (at DataBank, we use a 
  120-character limit [*usually])
* Limit comments to 72 characters per line<br>
  Yes, I have violated this rule in many of the lesson files
* Use blank lines to group functionally related sections of code
  (but not to excess)

> ["Try it Yourself" assignment 4.15](../Try%20it%20Yourself/00_my_answers.md)
> for instructions on how to set indents and/or guide-lines.
