# No Pastrami: Using the list sandwich_orders from Exercise 7-8, make sure the sandwich 'pastrami' appears in the list
#              at least three times. Add code near the beginning of your program to print a message saying the deli has
#              run out of pastrami, and then use a while loop to remove all occurrences of 'pastrami' from
#              sandwich_orders. Make sure no pastrami sandwiches end up in finished_sandwiches.
