# Imports: Using a program you wrote that has one function in it,
#          store that function in a separate file. Import the function
#          into your main program file, and call the function using
#          each of these approaches:
# ----------------------------------------------------
#     • import module_name
#     • from module_name import function_name
#     • from module_name import function_name as fn
#     • import module_name as mn
#     • from module_name import *
