print(place)

place = city_country("dublin", "ireland")
print(place)

place = city_country("vienna", "austria")

### Assignment 8.7 - Album

Write a function called `make_album()` that builds a dictionary describing a 
music album. The function should take in an artist name and an album title, 
and it should return a dictionary containing these two pieces of information. 
Use the function to make three dictionaries representing different albums. 
Print each return value to show that the dictionaries are storing the album 
information correctly.

Use `None` to add an optional parameter to `make_album()` that allows you to 
store the number of songs on an album. If the calling line includes a value 
for the number of songs, add that value to the album's dictionary. Make at 
least one new function call that includes the number of songs on an album.

Solution:

<details>
<summary>Spoiler Code</summary>

```python
def make_album(artist, album, songs=None):
    """Return a dictionary describing a music album"""
    album = {"Artist": artist.title(), "Title": album.title()}
    if songs:
        album["Tracks"] = songs
    return album

album = make_album("pink floyd", "animals")
print(album)
album = make_album("simon & garfunkel", "sounds of silence")
print(album)
album = make_album("they might be giants", "flood")
print(album)
album = make_album("john prine", "fair & square", 14)
print(album)
```

</details>
<br>

<details>
<summary>Output</summary>

```

### Assignment 8.8 - User Albums

Start with your program from Exercise 8.7. Write a while loop that allows 
users to enter an album's artist and title. Once you have that information, 
call `make_album()` with the user's input and print the dictionary that's 
created. Be sure to include a quit value in the while loop.

Solution:

<details>
<summary>Spoiler Code</summary>

```python
def make_album(artist, album, songs=None):
    """Return a dictionary describing a music album"""
    album = {"Artist": artist.title(), "Title": album.title()}
    if songs:
        album["Tracks"] = songs
    return album


while True:
    print("\nPlease tell me about your album:")
    print("(enter 'q' at any time to quit)")

    artist = input("Artist: ")
    if artist == "q":
        break

    title = input("Album Title: ")
    if title == "q":
        break

    album = make_album(artist, title)
    print(f"\n{album}!")
```

</details>

print both of your lists to make sure the messages were moved correctly.

Solution:

<details>
<summary>Spoiler Code</summary>

        print(f"Sending message: {message}")
        sent_messages.append(message)


messages = ["Hi there!", "Having fun at code camp!", "Python is great!"]
sent_messages = []
send_messages(messages, sent_messages)

### Assignment 8.14 - Cars

Write a function that stores information about a car in a dictionary. The 
function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should 
then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments.

Call the function with the required information and two other name-value 
pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Your function should work for 
a call like this one:

```python
car = make_car("subaru", "outback", color = "blue", tow_package = True)
```

Print the dictionary that's returned to make sure all the information was 
stored correctly.

    return details

car = make_car("dodge", "challenger", color="header orange",
               feature="shaker", year=2014)
print(car)

### Assignment 8.15 - Printing Models

Put the functions for the example
[`printing_models.py`](../Textbook%20Downloads/E3/printing_models.py) in a 
separate file called `printing_functions.py`. Write an import statement at 
the top of `printing_models.py`, and modify the file to use the imported
functions.

Solution:

<details>
<summary>Spoiler Code</summary>

[printing_functions.py](./printing_functions.py)

```python
def print_models(unprinted_designs, completed_models):

    Move each design to completed_models after printing.
    """
    while unprinted_designs:
        current_design = unprinted_designs.pop()
        print(f"Printing model: {current_design}")
        completed_models.append(current_design)
        
def show_completed_models(completed_models):
    """Show all the models that were printed."""
    print("\nThe following models have been printed:")
    for completed_model in completed_models:
        print(completed_model)
```

Calling Code

```python
unprinted_designs = ["phone case", "robot pendant", "dodecahedron"]
completed_models = []

printing_functions.print_models(unprinted_designs, completed_models)
printing_functions.show_completed_models(completed_models)
