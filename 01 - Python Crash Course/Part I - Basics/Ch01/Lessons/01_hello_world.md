## Ch 1 - Lesson 1: Run a "Hello World" Program

The simplest (and most ubiquitous) program in most languages is simply to 
print a message on the screen.

Commonly, the first program a fledgling developer writes is one that prints
the string "Hello World"

In your code editor, create a file called "hello_world.py" and add the
following code to it.

```python
print("Hello World!")
```

In the code above, `print()` is a function (don't worry too much about that
for now - we'll learn a lot about functions as we forge ahead in the book).
Typically, parentheses in Python indicate that we're calling a function.

When you run the program, your terminal should display the following:<br>
`Hello World!`

And that's all there is to it. You've written (and executed) your first
program. From now on, you're a Python programmer! *No backsies!*
