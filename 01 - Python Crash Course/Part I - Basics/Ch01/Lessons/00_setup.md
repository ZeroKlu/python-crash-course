## Set Up Python

### Option 1: Setup Guides

In the `/00 - Resources/Setup Documents/` folder, you will find the 
following documents (which you can use to set up you development PC 
similarly to mine):

* [Development Setup Guide](../../../../00%20-%20Resources/Setup%20Documents/Setting%20Up%20Your%20Workstation%20for%20Development%20Training.pdf)
* [Python Setup Guide](../../../../00%20-%20Resources/Setup%20Documents/Setting%20Up%20Your%20Workstation%20for%20Python%20Training.pdf)

### Option 2: Minimal Setup

#### Install a Code Editor:

I use Visual Studio Code for Python training, but you can use whatever 
editor you prefer. If you choose to use Visual Studio Code, you can either:

* Download [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and 
  install manually<br>or
* Install using a package manager. I used WinGet, with this command:<br>
  `winget install Microsoft.VisualStudioCode`

---

#### Install Python

Python code requires the Python executable and framework libraries in 
order to run, so it's necessary to install Python itself.

As usual, you have a couple of options for installing Python:

* Download [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and install manually
  <br>*Note: Completing the book exercises requires at least version 3.9*
  <br>or
* Install using a package manager. I used WinGet, with this command:<br>
  `winget install Python.Python.3.11`

#### Test to Ensure Python is Installed

From a command prompt, do the following:

1. Run `python --version`, which should show your version, like `Python 3.11.4`
2. Run `python`, which should bring up the Python prompt: `>>>`
3. Type `print("Hello")` and press [ENTER], which should show `Hello`
4. Type `exit()`, and press [ENTER], which exits Python and returns you to
   your normal command prompt

### Documentation

Throughout both your initial study and later practice of Python, you'll often
find it useful to access the official
[Python Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/)
