Now that we've started using libraries, it's important to keep track of what we're installing.

It's not a good idea to just use your local machine's instance of Python and install everything there.
Instead, it is preferable to create a virtual environment (venv) and install only the libraries needed for 
  your project.

Here's how we do that.

1. Open the project folder in VS Code

2. Launch a terminal if one is not already open

3. Create the venv by running the following command in your terminal
   python -m venv .venv

   * This will create a virtual environment called .venv in your project folder
     It's not necessary to call it .venv (you can name it whatever you want), but it's customary

4. Activate the virtual environment by running the following command in your terminal
   .venv\scripts\activate

   * After this runs, your terminal prompt should show (.venv) at the left
     If you names yours something other than .venv, then the name you used goes in the command
       and appears in the terminal prompt
   * You can run the command 'deactivate' to deactivate the virtual environment at any time

5. Update PIP in the venv by running the following command in the terminal (while the venv is active)
   python -m pip install --upgrade pip

6. Install your needed libraries in the active venv
