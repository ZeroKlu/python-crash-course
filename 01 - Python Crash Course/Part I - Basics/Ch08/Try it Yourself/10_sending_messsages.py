# Assignment 8.10
# Sending Messages: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 8-9. Write a function called send_messages() that
#                   prints each text message and moves each message to a new list called sent_messages as itâ€™s printed.
#                   After calling the function, print both of your lists to make sure the messages were moved correctly.

print("Try-it-Yourself:")
