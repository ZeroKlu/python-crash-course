The following is a summary of specific changes that have been made in the third edition:

• Chapter  1 now features the text editor VS Code, which is popular among beginner and professional programmers and
             works well on all operating systems.

• Chapter  2 includes the new methods removeprefix() and removesuffix(), which are helpful when working with files
             and URLs. This chapter also features Python’s newly improved error messages, which provide much more
			 specific information to help you troubleshoot your code when something goes wrong.

• Chapter 10 uses the pathlib module for working with files. This is a much simpler approach to reading from and
             writing to files.

• Chapter 11 uses pytest to write automated tests for the code you write. The pytest library has become the industry
             standard tool for writing tests in Python. It’s friendly enough to use for your first tests, and if you
			 pursue a career as a Python programmer, you’ll use it in professional settings as well.

• Chapter 12 through 14: The Alien Invasion project includes a setting to control the frame rate, which makes the
             game run more consistently across different operating systems. A simpler approach is used to build the
			 fleet of aliens, and the overall organization of the project has been cleaned up as well.

• Chapter 15 through 17: The data visualization projects in Chapters 15–17 use the most recent features of Matplotlib
             and Plotly. The Matplotlib visualizations feature updated style settings. The random walk project has a
			 small improvement that increases the accuracy of the plots, which means you’ll see a wider variety of
			 patterns emerge each time you generate a new walk. All the projects featuring Plotly now use the Plotly
			 Express module, which lets you generate your initial visualizations with just a few lines of code. You
			 can easily explore a variety of visualizations before committing to one kind of plot, and then focus on
			 refining individual elements of that plot.

• Chapter 18 through 20: The Learning Log project in Chapters 18−20 is built using the latest version of Django and
             styled using the latest version of Bootstrap. Some parts of the project have been renamed to make it easier
			 to follow the overall organization of the project. The project is now deployed to Platform.sh, a modern
			 hosting service for Django projects. The deployment process is controlled by YAML configuration files,
			 which give you a great deal of control over how your project is deployed. This approach is consistent with
			 how professional programmers deploy modern Django projects.

• Appendix A has been fully updated to recommend current best practices for installing Python on all major operating
             systems.

• Appendix B includes detailed instructions for setting up VS Code, and brief descriptions of most of the major text
             editors and IDEs in current use.

• Appendix C directs readers to several of the most popular online resources for getting help.

• Appendix D continues to offer a mini crash course in using Git for version control.

• Appendix E is brand new for the third edition. Even with a good set of instructions for deploying the apps you create,
             there are many things that can go wrong. This appendix offers a detailed troubleshooting guide that you can
			 use when the deployment process doesn’t work on the first try.

• The Index  has been thoroughly updated to allow you to use Python Crash Course as a reference for all of your future
             Python projects.
