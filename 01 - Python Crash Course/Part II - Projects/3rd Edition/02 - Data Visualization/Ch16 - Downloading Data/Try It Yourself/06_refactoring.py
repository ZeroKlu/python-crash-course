# Assignment 16.06
# Refactoring: The loop that pulls data from all_eq_dicts uses variables for the magnitude, longitude, latitude,
#              and title of each earthquake before appending these values to their appropriate lists. This approach
#              was chosen for clarity in how to pull data from a JSON file, but it’s not necessary in your code.
#              Instead of using these temporary variables, pull each value from eq_dict and append it to the appropriate
#              list in one line. Doing so should shorten the body of this loop to just four lines.
