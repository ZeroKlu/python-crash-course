# Assignment 17.02
# Active Discussions: Using the data from hn_submissions.py, make a bar chart showing the most active discussions
#                     currently happening on Hacker News. The height of each bar should correspond to the number of
#                     comments each submission has. The label for each bar should include the submission's title and
#                     should act as a link to the discussion page for that submission.
