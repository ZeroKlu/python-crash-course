"""Assignment 15.06"""
# Two D8s: Create a simulation showing what happens when you roll two eight-sided
#          dice 1000 times. Try to picture what you think the visualization will
#          look like before you run the simulation; then see if your intuition was
#          correct. Gradually increase the number of rolls until you start to see
#          the limits of your systemâ€™s capabilities.
