## Making a Game

The Pygame library provides pre-built functionality for 
creating and running games.

Using Pygame, the book walks us through the process of creating a
playable game called "Alien Invasion" in Python.

This game is similar to the classic arcade game "Space Invaders".

### Edition Note

This project has a broader scope than previous lessons and is largely the
same across both the 2nd and 3rd editions of the textbook.

The small differences in the code mostly show changes in the best practices
for using Pygame in Python.

Because of those factors, I am only presenting the 3rd edition version
here.
