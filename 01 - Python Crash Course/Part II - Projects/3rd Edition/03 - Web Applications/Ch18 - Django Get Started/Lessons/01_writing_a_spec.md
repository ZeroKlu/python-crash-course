## Writing a Specification

When starting work on something as significant as a web app, you 
first need to describe the project’s goals in a specification, or 
spec. Once you have a clear set of goals, you can start to identify 
manageable tasks to achieve those goals.

### The Spec

The purpose of the spec is not to limit creativity but to ensure that
the project remains on track and prevent scope creep.

Here is the spec for the Learning Log chapters:

* We'll write a web app called Learning Log that allows users to log 
  the topics they’re interested in and make journal entries as they learn about each topic.
    * The Learning Log home page will describe the site and invite 
      users to either register or log in.
    * Once logged in, a user can create new topics, add new entries, 
      and read and edit existing entries.

This is an overly simplified example of a spec, but it will suffice 
for this lesson.

In the real world, a spec should include things like:

* Descriptions of exact business processes
* Layouts/mockups of the site
* Specific technologies to be used
* QA testing requirements
* Etc.
