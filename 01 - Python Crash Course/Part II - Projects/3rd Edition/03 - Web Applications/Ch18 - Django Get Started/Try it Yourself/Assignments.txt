Chapter 18:

Assignment 18.1: New Projects
                 To get a better idea of what Django does, build a
                 couple empty projects and look at what Django creates.
                 Make a new folder with a simple name, like tik_gram or
                 insta_tok (outside of your learning_log directory),
                 navigate to that folder in a terminal, and create a
                 virtual environment. Install Django and run the
                 command django-admin.py startproject tg_project .
                 (making sure to include the dot at the end of the
                 command).

                 Look at the files and folders this command creates,
                 and compare them to Learning Log. Do this a few
                 times, until you’re familiar with what Django creates
                 when starting a new project. Then delete the project
                 directories if you wish.

Assignment 18.2: Short Entries
                 The `__str__()` method in the Entry model currently
                 appends an ellipsis to every instance of Entry when
                 Django shows it in the admin site or the shell. Add
                 an if statement to the __str__() method that adds an
                 ellipsis only if the entry is longer than 50
                 characters. Use the admin site to add an entry
                 that's fewer than 50 characters in length, and check
                 that it doesn’t have an ellipsis when viewed.

Assignment 18.3: The Django API
                 When you write code to access the data in your project,
                 you're writing a query. Skim through the documentation
                 for querying your data at
                 https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/topics/db/queries.
                 Much of what you see will look new to you, but it will
                 be quite useful as you start to work on your own
                 projects.

Assignment 18.4: Pizzeria
                 Start a new project called pizzeria_project with an
                 app called pizzas. Define a model Pizza with a field
                 called name, which will hold name values, such as
                 Hawaiian and Meat Lovers. Define a model called
                 Topping with fields called pizza and name. The pizza
                 field should be a foreign key to Pizza, and name
                 should be able to hold values such as pineapple,
                 Canadian bacon, and sausage.

                 Register both models with the admin site, and use the
                 site to enter some pizza names and toppings. Use the
                 shell to explore the data you entered.
