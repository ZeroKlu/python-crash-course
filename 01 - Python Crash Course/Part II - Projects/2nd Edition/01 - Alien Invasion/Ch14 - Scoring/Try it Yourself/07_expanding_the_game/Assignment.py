# Assignment 14.7
# Expanding the Game: Think of a way to expand Alien Invasion. For example, you could program the aliens
#                     to shoot bullets down at the ship or add shields for your ship to hide behind, which
#                     can be destroyed by bullets from either side. Or use something like the pygame.mixer
#                     module to add sound effects, such as explosions and shooting sounds.
