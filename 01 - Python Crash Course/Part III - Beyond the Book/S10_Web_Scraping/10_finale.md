## The Grand Finale

We've created a pretty thorough project for this simple example site.
Now is the time to handle a few extra tasks like:

* Migrate all hard-coded values to an external configuration file
* Refactor our functions to follow best practices
* Refactor the entire project into a class that groups together all of
  the related functionality we've assembled.

The full source code for this final version of the project is in

Code to execute the class is in [main.py](./main.py)

Application settings are in [data/secrets.json](./data/secrets.json)

As usual, the project utilizes the functions in
