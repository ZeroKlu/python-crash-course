## Beyond the Book

The good folks at [No Starch Press](https://nostarch.com/) are amazing. They
have published (in my opinion) the best introductory Python programming book
available, which is why I selected it for teaching this course.

However, it's impossible for an introductory textbook to include every
possible topic that you need to learn to be ready for programming in Python.

This section of lessons are add-on topics that I think are valuable for a
beginning developer.

Sorry about that.

To save effort reproducing utility functions, in some of these lessons, I
will use a practice library I created (see 
[Publishing a Library](./S13_Publish_a_Library/00_intro.md)).

To install this library, run the following command:

```
python -m pip install sm_utils
```

<br>There is no specific order in which these topics must be covered, but I do
recommend completing [Part I - Basics](../Part%20I%20-%20Basics/) before
delving into these more advanced topics.

Happy Coding!
