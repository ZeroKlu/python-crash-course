## What Is SciPy?

SciPy is a scientific computation library that layers atop NumPy. This adds
utility functions for optimization, statistics, and signal processing.

Where NumPy is the go-to library for creating and manipulating n-dimensional
arrays, SciPy is the extension to use those arrays for modern data science.
