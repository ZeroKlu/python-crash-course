## Truth Tables ##

### Refresher: Logic Operators ###

When working with Boolean (logical) operators, we compare the values
```true``` and ```false```

As a refresher, here are the truth tables for the common logical 
operations:

---

Negation (NOT)

| ! | p |
|:--|--:|
| F | t |
| T | f |

---

Conjunction (AND)

| p |and| q |
|:--|:-:|--:|
| t | T | t |
| t | F | f |
| f | F | t |
| f | F | f |

---

Disjunction (OR)

| p | or| q |
|:--|:-:|--:|
| t | T | t |
| t | T | f |
| f | T | t |
| f | F | f |

---

Exclusive Disjunction (XOR)

Note: I'll use ⊕ as the XOR symbol, since this operator typically doesn't 
exist in most programming languages.

| p | ⊕ | q |
|:--|:-:|--:|
| t | F | t |
| t | T | f |
| f | T | t |
| f | F | f |

### Bitwise Operators ###

When performing bitwise operations, we compare ```0``` and ```1``` at each 
bit position instead of ```true``` and ```false```.

Complement (Negation)

| ~ | b |
|:--|--:|
| 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 |

---

Conjunction (AND)

| b1 | & | b2 |
|:---|:-:|---:|
| 1  | 1 |  1 |
| 1  | 0 |  0 |
| 0  | 0 |  1 |
| 0  | 0 |  0 |

---

Disjunction (OR)

| b1 | │ | b2 |
|:---|:-:|---:|
| 1  | 1 |  1 |
| 1  | 1 |  0 |
| 0  | 1 |  1 |
| 0  | 0 |  0 |

---

Exclusive Disjunction (XOR)

| b1 | ^ | b2 |
|:---|:-:|---:|
| 1  | 0 |  1 |
| 1  | 1 |  0 |
| 0  | 1 |  1 |
| 0  | 0 |  0 |

### Remember ###

These truth tables just show what would happen at a single bit position.
When we implement these processes using byte or multiple-byte sized types, 
any of these operations will be performed for every bit position across 
both operands.
