## Warning!

Just a heads-up...

For those of you who are mainly interested in practical programming, the early parts of this section may not be for you.

I'll be getting into the underlying theory of binary integers, the 
circuits used to add binary values, and the theoretical basis of the
integer system as implemented in the computer.

This is all valuable information and will help you understand why certain
situations in bitwise computation behave the way they do, but it's not
compulsory in order to perform the bitwise computations we'll learn later.

If you want to omit the theory and go straight to the logic and programming
with bitwise operations, skip to the [Truth Tables](./10_truth_tables.md)
lesson.

Otherwise, hang on. It's a bit of a bumpy ride...
