## Probability Distributions

Probability distributions compute the probability of events occurring over 
time.

Mathematically, events can be discrete, like the possible faces of a die,
or continuous, like average height in a population.

There are many types of probability distributions used in data analysis, 
and The NumPy `random` library exposes functions for quite a few.
