## Probability Distributions

Probability distributions compute the probability of events occurring over 
time.

Mathematically, events can be discrete, like the possible faces of a die,
or continuous, like average height in a population.

There are many types of probability distributions used in data analysis, 
and The NumPy `random` library exposes functions for quite a few.

### Important!

Do not let this section bog you down. There's a lot of repetition in here,
and if you don't need to do probability analyses, much of it may not apply
to you.

Feel free to bug out on this section as early as you like, and proceed
to the [NumPy `ufunc` Topic](../../03_NumPy_Ufunc/00_ufunc.md)
